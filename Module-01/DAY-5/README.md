# Ex.No:1(E)  STATIC VARIABLE

## AIM:
To write a Java program to print student details (name and age), where age is the same for all students. Use a static variable to represent the age and demonstrate its use in accessing a shared value across all class objects

## ALGORITHM :
1.	Start the program.
2.	Create a class named Student.
3.	Declare a static variable age in the Student class.
4.	Declare an instance variable name.
5.	Create a constructor to initialize the student's name.
6.	Define a method displayDetails() to print the student's name and age.
7.	In the main method:
I.	Assign a value to the static variable age.
II.	Create multiple Student objects with different names.
III.	Call the displayDetails() method for each student.
8.	End the program.

```

## Sourcecode.java:
```
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Main{
public static void main (String[] args){
int num=7;
find_Oddeven(num);
}

static void find_Oddeven(int num){
  if(num%2==0) 
      System.out.println(num+" is even"); 
  else 
      System.out.println(num+" is odd");
 }
}
```

## RESULT:
Thus, the Java program for the concept of using a static variable for shared data was correctly implemented and verified successfully.
